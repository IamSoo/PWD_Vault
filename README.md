# PWD_Vault

PWD_Vault is a versatile everyday use password manager tool.
This program uses encryption to store your valuable data that is decrypted with this program.

# How to install:
Download the zip via `github.com/nightmare-tech/PWD_Vault` or clone it via git :-
```
git clone https://nightmare-tech/PWD_Vault
```
    
   It is a very small repository. So, I didn't need another way to install it. And itâ€™s the easiest :)


# How to run:
!!!!! Ensure that you have ran the following commands before running the script!!!!!
* `pip install cryptography`
* `pip install passlib`
* `pip install pandas`
* `pip install getpass`

Alternative >
You could run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the above package

!!!! This installs the dependencies of the python script !!!!

* For Windows users:
    Click on the batch file `PWD_Vault.bat` from your file manager or execute the batch file by typing
    `PWD_Vault.bat` in your console in the cloned directory (Windows Terminal, cmd etc.) 
    
* For Linux users:
    Make the bash script executable (only need to do one time) :-
    ```
    chmod +x PWD_Vault.sh
    ```
    Then running the bash script:-
    ```
    ./PWD_Vault.sh
    ```

* Alternative: 
  Run the python file `PWD_Vault.py` in the directory `PWD_Vault` directly:-
  ```
  cd PWD_Vault
  python3 PWD_Vault.py
  ```
    This is what the .bat and .sh scripts do. It just looks neat this way :)
